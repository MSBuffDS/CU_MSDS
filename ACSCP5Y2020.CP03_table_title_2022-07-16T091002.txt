COMPARATIVE ECONOMIC CHARACTERISTICS
Geographic areas are based on the geographic boundaries of the data year. Current year comparisons with past-year estimates are not re-tabulated to the current year's geographies; rather, the comparison is with the existing geography of each data year. Statistically significant change from prior years' estimates could be the result of changes in the geographic boundaries of an area and not necessarily the demographic, social, or economic characteristics. For more information on geographic changes, see: <a href="https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/guidance.html">https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/guidance.html</a>.<br/><br/>

Beginning in 2017, selected variable categories were updated, including age-categories, income-to-poverty ratio (IPR) categories, and the age universe for certain employment and education variables. See user note entitled <a href="https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/technical-documentation/user-notes.html">"Health Insurance Table Updates"</a> for further details.<br/><br/>

2019 ACS data products include updates to several categories of the existing means of transportation question. For more information, see: <a href="http://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/technical-documentation/user-notes/2020-03.html">Change to Means of Transportation.</a><br/><br/>

Between 2018 and 2019 the American Community Survey retirement income question changed. These changes resulted in an increase in both the number of households reporting retirement income and higher aggregate retirement income at the national level. For more information see <a href="https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/technical-documentation/user-notes/2020-01.html">Changes to the Retirement Income Question</a> .<br/><br/>

In 2019, methodological changes were made to the class of worker question. These changes involved modifications to the question wording, the category wording, and the visual format of the categories on the questionnaire. The format for the class of worker categories are now listed under the headings "Private Sector Employee," "Government Employee," and "Self-Employed or Other." Additionally, the category of Active Duty was added as one of the response categories under the "Government Employee" section for the mail questionnaire. For more detailed information about the 2019 changes, see the 2016 American Community Survey Content Test Report for Class of Worker located at <a href="https://www.census.gov/library/working-papers/2017/acs/2017_Martinez_01.html"> http://www.census.gov/library/working-papers/2017/acs/2017_Martinez_01.html</a>.<br/><br/>

Since the 5-year data do not benefit from data quality filtering, comparisons are only made for populations of 5,000 or more.<br/><br/>

Logical coverage edits applying a rules-based assignment of Medicaid, Medicare and military health coverage were added as of 2009 -- please see <a href="https://www.census.gov/library/working-papers/2010/demo/coverage_edits_final.html">https://www.census.gov/library/working-papers/2010/demo/coverage_edits_final.html</a> for more details. Select geographies of 2008 data comparable to the 2009 and later tables are available at <a href="https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/acs/1-year-re-run-health-insurance.html">https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/acs/1-year-re-run-health-insurance.html</a>. The health insurance coverage category names were modified in 2010.

The categories for relationship to householder were revised in 2019. For more information see <a href="https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/technical-documentation/user-notes/2020-02.html">Revisions to the Relationship to Household item</a>.<br/><br/>

Supporting documentation on code lists, subject definitions, data accuracy, and statistical testing can be found on the American Community Survey website in the <a href="https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/technical-documentation/code-lists.html">Technical Documentation</a> section.<br /><br />Sample size and data quality measures (including coverage rates, allocation rates, and response rates) can be found on the American Community Survey website in the <a href="https://www.census.gov/acs/www/methodology/sample_size_and_data_quality/">Methodology</a> section.<br/><br/>

Although the American Community Survey (ACS) produces population, demographic and housing unit estimates, for 2020, the 2020 Census provides the official counts of the population and housing units for the nation, states, counties, cities, and towns. For 2016 to 2019, the Population Estimates Program provides estimates of the population for the nation, states, counties, cities, and towns and intercensal housing unit estimates for the nation, states, and counties.<br/><br/>

The definitions of the metropolitan and micropolitan statistical areas for the 2013 American Community Survey are based on the commuting patterns identified in the 2010 Census. Estimates prior to 2013 are based on the results of the 2000 Census. Statistically significant change from prior years' estimates could be the result of changes in the metropolitan geographic definitions and not necessarily the demographic, social or economic characteristic. For more information, see: <a href="https://www.census.gov/population/metro/data/metrodef.html"> Metropolitan and Micropolitan Statistical Areas</a>.<br/><br/>

Beginning in data year 2019, respondents to the Weeks Worked question provided an integer value for the number of weeks worked. For data years 2008 through 2018, respondents selected a category corresponding to the number of weeks worked.<br/><br/>

Data are based on a sample and are subject to sampling variability. The degree of uncertainty for an estimate arising from sampling variability is represented through the use of a margin of error. The value shown here is the 90 percent margin of error. The margin of error can be interpreted roughly as providing a 90 percent probability that the interval defined by the estimate minus the margin of error and the estimate plus the margin of error (the lower and upper confidence bounds) contains the true value. In addition to sampling variability, the ACS estimates are subject to nonsampling error (for a discussion of nonsampling variability, see <a href="https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/technical-documentation.html">ACS Technical Documentation</a>). The effect of nonsampling error is not represented in these tables.<br/><br/>

Employment and unemployment estimates may vary from the official labor force data released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics because of differences in survey design and data collection. For guidance on differences in employment and unemployment estimates from different sources go to <a href="https://www.census.gov/topics/employment/labor-force/guidance/survey-differences.html">Labor Force Guidance</a>.<br/><br/>

Estimates of urban and rural populations, housing units, and characteristics reflect boundaries of urban areas defined based on Census 2010 data. As a result, data for urban and rural areas from the ACS do not necessarily reflect the results of ongoing urbanization.<br/><br/>

An * indicates that the estimate is significantly different (at a 90% confidence level) than the estimate from the most current year. A "c" indicates the estimates for that year and the current year are both controlled; a statistical test is not appropriate. A blank indicates that the estimate is not significantly different from the estimate of the most current year, or that a test could not be done because one or both of the estimates is displayed as "-", "N", or "(X)", or the estimate ends with a "+" or "-". (For more information on these symbols, see the Explanation of Symbols below this table.)<br/><br/>

Workers include members of the Armed Forces and civilians who were at work last week.<br/><br/>

Census occupation titles and their codes are based on the 2018 revision of the Standard Occupational Classification (SOC). Occupation data from 2018 and later are not strictly comparable to data from 2017 or prior. For more information on the Census occupation code changes, please visit our website at <a href="https://www.census.gov/topics/employment/industry-occupation/guidance/code-lists.html">https://www.census.gov/topics/employment/industry-occupation/guidance/code-lists.html</a>.<br/><br/>

Industry titles and their 4-digit codes are based on the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS). The Census industry codes for 2018 and later years are based on the 2017 revision of the NAICS. To allow for the creation of multiyear tables, industry data in the multiyear files (prior to data year 2018) were recoded to the 2017 Census industry codes. We recommend using caution when comparing data coded using 2017 Census industry codes with data coded using Census industry codes prior to data year 2018. For more information on the Census industry code changes, please visit our website at <a href="https://www.census.gov/topics/employment/industry-occupation/guidance/code-lists.html">https://www.census.gov/topics/employment/industry-occupation/guidance/code-lists.html</a>.<br/><br/>

The 2016-2020 American Community Survey (ACS) data generally reflect the September 2018 Office of Management and Budget (OMB) delineations of metropolitan and micropolitan statistical areas. In certain instances, the names, codes, and boundaries of the principal cities shown in ACS tables may differ from the OMB delineation lists due to differences in the effective dates of the geographic entities.<br/><br/>
